        <h2>INTRO</h2>
        <p>Most of us at least once bought something online. I must admit I buy most of my things on the Internet. It's quick, and I don't have to wander around the stillages in stationery shops. But there is one thing that bothers me in some online stores - the process of purchase. Lots of them just make it difficult and don't reach my expectations leaving pretty bad user experience. I've talked to my friends and it turned out they feel the same. <b>I've decided to create the ultimate purchasing process</b>, to make us, customers, happy. I've focused on clothing stores and the journey from activities on a <b>product details page to finalization of the transaction</b>. The final <b>result is <a class="linkUnderline" href="https://preview.uxpin.com/b834c3de34fd86607985b0dea2498728db3a2a2c#/pages/108809040?mode=cvhdf" target="_blank">a prototype in UXPin</a></b>, which you can try out.</p>

            UNDERSTANDING
            <span>THE USERS</span>
        </h2>
        <p>Any good experience can't be designed without awareness of what is needed and avoided. To understand customers of online shops I've conducted <b>in-depth interviews</b> with 2 people frequently using the Internet to purchase everyday things (mostly clothes, medicines, and consumer electronics). Aside from answering the questions, users were asked to pretend to buy certain products on a few websites they mentioned during the interview.</p>

        <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3>

        <h4>Needs</h4>
        <p>
            During the interviews, I asked each respondent to evaluate his/her favorite online store in terms of purchase experience. The results were pretty similar:
        </p>
        <ul class="users__list">
            <li>Users want to <b>quickly find the product</b> they are looking for in the online shop.</li>
            <li>They expect the products to be <b>well and exhaustively described, with lots of photos.</b></li>
            <li>Clear information about <b>shipping price is highly appreciated</b>, the same as <b>reviews from other customers </b> (respondents tend to check the genuineness of such reviews).</li>
            <li>After choosing desired product users want to <b>make sure they are buying the right product</b>.</li>
            <li>Extremely important is <b>the feeling of control</b>.</li>
            <li>Users also want to use <b>safe payment methods</b> and would like to <b>leave additional information to the seller</b>.</li>
            <li>In case of buying clothing online users want to <b>check the measurements of the clothes </b>to make sure they will fit. They also check if they can <b>return the clothes</b> if they won't.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pain points</h4>
        <p>Besides well-known user pain points (e.g. <b>badly described products, non-intuitive purchase process, too much personal information required to place an order</b>, etc.) there were a few interesting cases, which I've pointed below.<br>
        <br>
        Very interesting was user’s reaction to review section at X-KOM website. A user, which generally had a good experience while using the site, first got even happier when he saw the reviews of the desired product. Then <b> he got upset after he found out that everyone can write a review of each product, without any verification if he/she bought it.</b> He found it a bit deceptive.
        </p>

        <div class="users__blockquote">
            <blockquote>I don't like the fact that one can add a review of the product without buying it, or at least signing up. It gives room for maneuver for the marketing specialists.</blockquote>
            <p>Original in Polish: <q>“Nie podoba mi się to, że dodanie opinii nie wymaga ani zakupu produktu, ani nawet założenia konta. To daje duże pole do manewru osobom od marketingu.”</q></p>
        </div>

        <p>The next pain point happened on samuraj.net.pl. The user hasn't been shown the total price after he chose the product, shipment and payment methods. <b>The shipping cost was added at the end of the site. The user got to know the total price after he placed the order. </b>

        <div class="users__picture-wrapper  users__picture-wrapper_small">
            <div class="picture">
                <img tabindex="0" class="lozad" data-src="../_img/purchasing/pain1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an online store featuring not user-friendly order summary.">
                <h5>An example of a pretty bad summary. No total price is shown. Additionally, a button 'Continue shopping' of the same weight as a button ‘Place an order' may distract customers and delay the purchase.</h5>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>At the same store, the user was shown <b>no possibility of shipping after he chose cash on delivery as a payment method</b>. He found it confusing and wasn't sure if the order will be shipped. Furthermore, trying to place an order was pointless - <b>the website kept refreshing after clicking 'Place an order' button, with no feedback on what went wrong.</b></p>

        <div class="users__picture-wrapper">
            <div class="picture">
                <img tabindex="0" class="lozad" data-src="../_img/purchasing/pain2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an online store featuring no possibility of shipping after choosing delivery as a payment method.">
                <h5>After choosing cash on delivery as a payment method, the user was shown no possibility of shipping.</h5>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>A user who buys most of her clothes online was a bit confused when <b>information on the product's size wasn't consistent with the size chart on the page</b>. In one place it was written the size 36 is suitable for waist 70cm, while in the other (on the same page) - 75cm, which is a really big difference.</p>

        <div class="users__picture-wrapper">
            <div class="picture">
                <img tabindex="0" class="lozad" data-src="../_img/purchasing/pain3.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an online store featuring 2 inconsistent information about clothing size.">
                <h5>On the product page the user found 2 inconsistent information about the clothing size.</h5>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Different store, another size failure. This time the user was shocked about the size measurements. Theoretically, the sizes were ranged from S to 2XL. In fact, the biggest size (2XL) had 74 cm in the waist (37x2), which is more around size M in other stores.</p>

        <div class="users__picture-wrapper">
            <div class="picture">
                <img tabindex="0" class="lozad" data-src="../_img/purchasing/pain4.jpg" alt="A screenshot of an online store featuring a sizechart.">
                <h5>Unusual size range and the way measures are taken (half of waist circumference).</h5>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="users__blockquote">
            <blockquote>It's so depressing. Usually, I wear S, sometimes M, but here I should buy an XXL size. This is madness.</blockquote>
            <p>Original in Polish: <q>“To przygnębiające. Normalnie noszę S, czasem M, a tu powinnam kupić XXL. To szaleństwo.</q></p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            It's no secret that online shops primarily target to increase conversion rates. The website has to convert. Customers shouldn't be distracted on their way to purchase.<br>
            To attract more customers online shops should also keep gaining more and more popularity. Still, the most significant is meeting customers' needs, which were described in the antecedent section about understanding the users.

        <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>I've analyzed a few popular online clothing stores to get a sense of what the market needs and pains are. I also wanted to get to know existing solutions to get some inspirations, and what is more important - to find some gaps to fill them with some good UX. The analysis is mostly based on the data gathered via user interviews and my previous UX knowledge. I've written down some of my observations. Check out the results below.</p>

        <h2>SKETCH</h2>

        <p>
            Below you can find paper wireframes of the purchase process I've prepared. They are based on the data gathered and my UX knowledge. In the next step, I've translated them into a fully working high fidelity <a class="linkUnderline" href="https://preview.uxpin.com/b834c3de34fd86607985b0dea2498728db3a2a2c#/pages/108809040?mode=cvhdf" target="_blank">prototype in UXPin</a>.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Please note:</b> I've focused on the journey starting with visiting product details page up to checkout process. Therefore in the mockups, you won't find a menu, footer nor any other section I wasn't focused on.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h5 class="sketch__list-header"><b>Reasoning:</b></h5>
        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Big, fixed-position product photo gallery</b> - The gallery has fixed-position, so user can check out product details without losing sight of the photos.</li>
            <li><b>Information about model’s size and height provided</b> - It allows user to choose the right size by comparing his height and body type to model's ones.</li>
            <li><b> Mouseover zoom </b> - The image is zoomed on mouse over, to show the product from close-up.</li>
            <li><b>Arrow up to get user to the top</b> - When scrolled too far user can one-click arrow in the bottom right corner to go to top (of course to click our lovely 'Buy now' or 'Go to cart' button)</li>
            <li><b>One-click size change</b> - User sees on an instant which sizes are available and one-clicks them to choose, without unnecessary dropdowns.</li>
            <li><b>Drop a hint to a friend</b> - A possibility to send a friend a link to a product on an e-mail. User may use one of 3 templates to send a message. It may be a hint on a gift for a birthday or just a recommendation for a friend. User can enter his e-mail address to receive a copy of an e-mail sent to a friend.</li>
            <li><b>Added to wishlist microinteraction</b> - When user adds the item to a wishlist the heart icon gets filled to show user the action was done well.</li>
            <li><b>Shipment time information</b> - To let user know if the item will be sent the next day or next week.</li>
            <li><b>Items in stock information</b> - To let the user know if there's only one item left in stock and he needs to buy quickly or there's more and he has some time to consider the purchase</li>
            <li><b>Extensive product description</b> - The description should be as precise and exhaustive as possible. The material composition, pattern, occasion, storage and cleaning methods - all of it and more. There are people who cannot base their decisions on images (e.g. people with eye diseases like failing eyesight or blindness) and need an exhaustive description to choose the right product.</li>
            <li><b>Consistent size chart</b> - This is a must-have. Sizes must be well described in all dimensions, depending on the type of clothing. It's courted to show a picture showing how to measure the body. This will avoid user guessing the size and further disappointment.</li>
            <li><b>Described payment and shipping methods, as well as return policy</b> - To avoid disappointment the user should have a possibility to check payment and shipping costs before he goes to checkout.</li>
            <li><b>Available product reviews with a bit of gamification</b> - User who bought certain product can leave a review. Others can evaluate usefulness of the review by clicking one of two buttons: YES for helpful reviews, and NO for not helpful ones. Users with the best reviews could get discount codes. This will encourage customers to write picture-based, detailed reviews of the product.</li>
            <li><b>’Buy now’ and ‘Add to cart’ CTAs</b> - User might want to buy a certain product without the extra 'add to cart' step. The customer can choose which action he wants to take - buy the product now and end the exploration of the store, or add it to the cart and continue shopping.</li>
            <li><b>‘Added to cart’ widget</b> - On the widget, user is praised for his taste. He is also shown the product photo, the price, size, and color he chose to make sure it's the right one. On the widget, the user can either remove the product from the cart or move it to a wishlist.</li>
            <li><b>Breadcrumbs available</b> - User knows exactly which category the product belongs to and can quickly navigate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CART PAGE</h3>

        <h5 class="sketch__list-header"><b>Reasoning:</b></h5>
        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Removing an item from the cart</b> - It's easy to remove the item from the cart. If the user has removed it accidentally - there is a possibility to restore the item.</li>
            <li><b>Moving an item to wishlist</b> - If user doesn't want to buy the item now but he likes it, he doesn't have to remove it from the cart and lose it forever. He can one-click move it to a wish list and quickly find it when he wants to. Accidentally moving to the wishlist can also be restored.</li>
            <li><b>Applying a discount code</b> - User can apply a discount code and check the cost of the products on a cart level. To avoid distraction and leaving the checkout due to searching for the discount code on the net there is no possibility to apply the code on checkout process.</li>
            <li><b>Continue shopping button</b> - The user can go back to shopping just after he checks his cart.</li>
            <li><b>Fixed-position summary</b> - Very useful if there are more items in the cart. The summary has fixed position so user doesn't have to scroll down to see how much items are in the cart, how much they cost and how the discount code applied affects the costs. It also accelerates the decision to go to checkout because the CTA is always above the fold.</li>
            <li><b>Photo and product name linked to the product details page</b> - The user can quickly check out the details of the chosen product by clicking on photo or product name.</li>
            <li><b>Information about the size and color chosen + big photo</b> - Users need to make sure they’ve got the right product in the cart.</li>
            <li><b>Additional safety and delivery infos</b> - To make users feel more confident and secure, there is additional information about payment and delivery.</li>
            <li><b>Quantity of products in the whole cart shown</b> - If there are more items in the cart user doesn't need to count them by himself.</li>
            <li><b>Changing the quantity of items in the cart</b> - User can change the quantity of the product on the cart level.</li>
            <li><b>Auto refreshing</b> - If user makes some changes on his cart (eg. the quantity of the products) the page will automatically refresh. There is no need to click any 'Refresh' or 'Update' button.</li>
            <li><b>Visible CTA</b> - The button 'Go to checkout' is always visible due to the fixed-position summary component.</li>
            <li><b>Empty cart expression</b> - When there are no items in the cart user is encouraged to go straight to the product category and add some. There are also shown the most popular products in the store.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="sketch__list-header"><b>Reasoning:</b></h5>
        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Menu and footer removed</b> - All of the sections not connected to the checkout process are removed to keep users focused on the purchase (<b>applied to the whole checkout</b>).</li>
            <li><b>Possibility to buy as a guest</b> - To decrease friction, the user isn't forced to create an account in the store.</li>
            <li><b>User can log in using Facebook or Google</b> - Nowadays a lot of people tend to log in using Google or Facebook to make it faster.</li>
            <li><b>Advantages of creating account shown</b> - Customers mostly don't create accounts if there's no need to. Unless it's beneficial for them. Advantages are briefly listed to lure users to create the account in the store.</li>
            <li><b>Only needed information required</b> - When creating the account the only information required is an e-mail address and password (no repeating, if the user wants to make sure he wrote the password correctly he can use the ‘Show’ button).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sketch__step-header">Step 2. Delivery&Payment page</h4>

        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Fixed-position, auto-filled summary</b> - The fixed-position summary contains detailed cart content, chosen delivery and payment methods (auto-filled due to user decisions), discount applied and summary price. It's to make user more confident.</li>
            <li><b>Real-time validation</b> - After typing the data in inputs the user will be informed if it's ok. <b>Please note:</b> All of the possible alerts weren't shown in the prototype. The information should be detailed, and explain what went wrong and how to do it right.</li>
            <li><b>Delivery time information (date)</b> - Estimated delivery date (eg. April 24, Wednesday ) is placed beneath the chosen delivery method. It is to make it more tangible and comprehensible to the user.</li>
            <li><b>2-click possibility to create an account</b> - User can create an account, by entering the password. That's it. The registration will be confirmed by e-mail after placing an order. Fast and easy for users. </li>
            <li><b>Possibility to leave additional information</b> - To increase feeling of control the user can leave some notes to the seller.</li>
            <li><b>Tooltips explaining the need for providing e-mail address and telephone number</b> - Some users might not understand why this information is necessary. The tooltips should dispel their doubts.</li>
            <li><b>A brief description of each payment method</b> - The descriptions should briefly explain what will happen after choosing the method to give user a sense of control (eg. 'After placing an order in the next step you will be redirected to Przelewy24 Platform to make a payment').</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sketch__step-header">Step 3. Summary page</h4>
        <h5 class="sketch__list-header"><b>Reasoning:</b></h5>
        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Classic summary</b> - All of the information is presented to the user in a clear way, so it's easy to check if all the data provided are right. The user has to be 100% sure he is buying the item he has chosen (the right size, color, etc), for the price he agreed to, and there are no additional costs he didn't know about before.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sketch__step-header">Step 4. Confirmation page</h4>
        <h5 class="sketch__list-header"><b>Reasoning:</b></h5>
        <ul class="sketch__list">
            <li><b>Acknowledgement</b> - User is informed that the order confirmation has been sent on the email address given. It is a fine way to show the user that his actions brought results - the order has been placed and confirmed.</li>
            <li><b>Summary</b> - User is shown placed order details so he may check them and make sure the order will be realized successfully.</li>
            <li><b>Newsletter lure</b> - Let's make some use of the satisfied customer. Below the order summary, I've placed a boost to encourage the user to sign up to a newsletter to get an exclusive discount.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>
        <p>
           I’ve prepared a desktop prototype in UXPin using interactive states, conditions, expressions, and lots of variables.<br>
            <br>
            Check out the prototype under the following link. <b>Don't hesitate to try different combinations</b> (discounts, various quantity, different payment or delivery methods, and so on)!

        <p>I’m planning to conduct a few usability tests to refine the UXPin prototype.</p>

    <section id="takeaways" data-link-content="Takeaways">
        <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <p>
            <span>FIRST ONE: </span>I didn’t expect the prototype in UXPin can consist of <b>sooo many conditions, expressions, and variables</b>. I wish I had written them down at the beginning or at least mark some of the variables on wireframes to not get lost in the ocean of interactions. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out to work in the end, even though it took me some time.<br>
            <br>
            <span>SECOND ONE: </span>A bit connected to the first one. Well, you need to know, that at work I was using UXPin mostly for simple prototypes. The wireframes I've prepared for the project weren't simple at all. For the sake of my project, I’ve completely sunk into UXPin for almost a week. <b>I&nbsp;wanted to bring my vision alive so I needed to discover functions I&nbsp; didn't know before and use them</b>. It was SO worth it! I absolutely love to learn new things! That was a great time, and I've ended the project full of new UXPin knowledge! <br>Psst! Never knew it's such a great tool!
